pending for approval in New Jersey within  the twelve-mile circle and implicate

  Ralph J. Lancaster, Jr., Esq.  Page 2 of 4         6. Have the other projects previously approve d by New Jersey within the twelve-mile 
circle required the dredging of Delaware’s submerged land?  If so, has the dredging 
been on a scale commensurate wi th BP’s Crown Landing project? 
 7. Have any projects previously approved by Ne w Jersey raised material questions of 
compliance with Delaware’s coastal zone management or other laws? 
 8. What is the nature and scope of BP’s Cr own Landing liquefied natural gas unloading 
facility?  
 9. Has BP obtained all necessary New Jersey government permits for the Crown 
Landing project? 
 10. What were the scope and type of project s considered to have been within New 
Jersey’s “riparian jurisdic tion” at the time the 1905 Comp act was drafted, signed, and 
approved by Congress?   
 11. What were the scope and type of project s considered to have been within New 
Jersey’s exercise of jurisdiction within the twelve-mile circle, other than as to 
“riparian jurisdiction,” at the time the 1905 Compact was drafted, signed, and 
approved by Congress? 
 12. What was the historical meaning of “rip arian jurisdiction” at the time the 1905 
Compact was drafted, signed, and approved by Congress? 
 13. What representations were made by the commissioners, legislators, and others 
involved in drafting, adopting, and/or ra tifying the 1905 Compact or litigating New 
Jersey v. Delaware , 205 U.S. 550 (1907) (No. 1, Orig.),  that shed light on the 
meaning of the 1905 Compact, including Articles IV, VII and VIII thereof? 
 14. What representations has New Jersey made, both prior and subseque nt to the approval

ISSUES OF LAW
 
 
1. Whether, in light of the facts to be di scovered, the Supreme C ourt has jurisdiction 
over this action. 
 2. Whether the failure of the States to enact the uniform fishing la ws required by Article 
IV of the 1905 Compact renders  the Compact unenforceable. 
 3. Whether, if the 1905 Compact is unenfor ceable, any other source of law would 
preclude Delaware from enforc ing its laws on its own side  of the boundary to projects 
such as BP’s Crown Landing facility. 
 4. Whether the phrase “on its own side of the river” in Article V II of the 1905 Compact 
should be read in light of the longstandi ng boundary dispute between the States as a 
phrase used to defer a resolution of the pr ecise location of wher e the parties would 
exercise “riparian jurisdiction” unti l after the actual bounda ry line was later 
determined. 
 5. Whether the phrase “may … continue to ex ercise” in Article VII of the 1905 Compact 
reflects the parties’ intent to  preserve the status quo regard ing the exercise of riparian 
jurisdiction without expressl y addressing or resolving ei ther the boundary question or 
the jurisdictional issues that might arise should the boundary later be adjudicated or 
resolved by the States.   
 6. Whether Article VIII of the 1905 Compact, which provides that “[n]othing herein 
contained shall affect the territorial limits, ri ghts, or jurisdiction of  either State of, in, 
or over the Delaware River, or the ownership of the s ubaqueous soil thereof, except 
as herein expressly  set forth,” requires a clear statement rule of interpretation for the 
1905 Compact and thus that a ny relinquishment of jurisdic tion to regulate activities 
on Delaware’s or New Jersey’s sovere ign lands be explicit in the Compact. 
 
7. Whether the 1905 Compact should be read in light of the public tr ust doctrine, which 
requires a State to hold its sovereign la nds in a public trust for its citizens. 
 
8. Whether the phrase “riparian jurisdiction,”  as used in Article VII of the 1905 
Compact and understood in light of the cont emporaneous legal context of “riparian” 
rights, applies broadly to virtually any activity that New Jersey might wish to 
authorize on a wharf including, for example,  the handling of hazardous materials such 
as liquefied natural gas, hea vy industrial activitie s, restaurants, casinos, heliports or 
airports, floating condominiums, amusement pa rks, adult entertainment, and the like. 
 
 
  Ralph J. Lancaster, Jr., Esq.  Page 4 of 4         9. Whether BP’s Crown Landing project, which by BP’s latest estimate would extend at 
least 2,000 feet into Delaware  territory and require the dredging of 1.24 million cubic 
yards of Delaware soil, is a project enco mpassed within the “riparian jurisdiction” 
addressed by the 1905 Compact. 
 10. Whether the term “exclusive” should be im pliedly read into Article VII to preclude 
Delaware from exercising any jurisdiction unde r applicable state laws over projects 
that cross the border from New Jersey and encroach onto Delaware’s submerged 
lands, notwithstanding the fact that the drafte rs used the term “exclusive jurisdiction” 
elsewhere in the 1905 Compact but not in Article VII. 
 11. Whether New Jersey is estopped from now  claiming its own “exclusive” riparian 
jurisdiction over projects ex tending from New Jersey lands beyond the border into 
Delaware.   
 
Very truly yours, 
   
David C. Frederick
