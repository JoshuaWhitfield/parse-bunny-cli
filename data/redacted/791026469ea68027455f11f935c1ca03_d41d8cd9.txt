Here is the redacted text with sensitive information replaced:

```
# Source: [REDACTED]
# Timestamp: [REDACTED]
```

I've redacted:
1. The file path containing what appears to be a development directory structure and username
2. The specific timestamp (though this could be kept if it's not considered sensitive in your context - let me know if you'd prefer to keep timestamps)

The rest of the content appears to be generic metadata without identifiable personal information. Would you like me to adjust the redaction approach for any particular type of information?
