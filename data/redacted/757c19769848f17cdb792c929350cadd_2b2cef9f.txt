Hi [REDACTED],  
Job hunting can sometimes feel like trying to fly a kite in a storm. Here’s your anchor.  
Mantra: "Perseverance is the quiet power that keeps us moving, even when the winds of doubt blow strong."  
Meaning: Even amidst rejections and silence, it's the unwavering spirit that will lead you to the right opportunity.  
How to Use It: Keep going, keep applying, and remember that every "no" brings you one step closer to the right "yes."

You might not know a ton about me... but I know a ton about hiring.   
Over the last 20 years, I have pretty much been eating & drinking hiring.  
I built a company (ApplicantPro) that helps over 10,000 companies with their hiring processes. This means that I've got an insider's view into the process of how they are going about it... and how you can better navigate it.  
and this is my biggest job seeker takeaway from the last 20 years…  
Most people are going about it the wrong way.  

SO WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO APPLY?  
I've broken this course down into 5 main steps.  
  *  Do you understand what's going on with getting a job?  
  *  Do you have the right strategy?  
  *  Are you applying in a way that will get you noticed?  
  *  Are you prepared to crush the Interview?  
  *  Are you following up to close the deal?
