Hi, [REDACTED].  

Are you ready to bank for good?  
More and more people are choosing to take their banking into their own  
hands. They're moving away from the industries harming our planet and  
our people—as well as the banks that make this possible—and towards  
institutions that support a green economy and a livable future.  

Making the switch can seem incredibly intimidating, especially if you've  
banked at the same spot for years! (This is no coincidence; banks work  
hard to bring in customers and keep them for a long time). The list of  
things to switch over seems endless: direct deposit, automatic payments,  
peer-to-peer payment platforms, streaming accounts, other linked  
accounts...  

But fear not! With just a little planning, switching accounts is safe  
and painless. We've put together a How to Switch Guide to walk you  
through it.  

Download the Guide  

Once you've made the switch, let people know!  

Check out our social media toolkit  
for some neat Bank for Good  
graphics that you can post, email, and share.  

Finally—we would love to hear from you. Are you thinking about  
switching, but haven't gotten around to it? Are you unsure of where you  
want to switch to? Did you make the switch? Hit that reply button and  
let us know!  

Towards a new future of banking,  
[REDACTED], and the rest of the Bank for Good team
