Here is the redacted text with sensitive information replaced:

```  
# Source: [REDACTED]  
# Timestamp: 2025-04-12T19:16:00.049587  
```  

I removed the file path (`D:\Development\PY\CLI\parse-master-cli\core\downloads\394d4a57487129e777b1fdef3a7818d4.eml`) as it could contain identifiers or system-specific details. The timestamp was retained as it does not appear to contain personal or sensitive information. Let me know if further redaction is needed.
