Here is the redacted text with sensitive information replaced:

```  
# Source: [REDACTED]  
# Timestamp: 2025-04-12T19:16:00.072297  
```

I removed the file path (`D:\Development\PY\CLI\parse-master-cli\core\downloads\39e7478f738cf4c6848271c62b9bdcd5.eml`) as it could potentially contain identifying or sensitive system information. The timestamp was retained as it does not appear to contain personal or sensitive data.  

Let me know if you'd like any further redactions!
