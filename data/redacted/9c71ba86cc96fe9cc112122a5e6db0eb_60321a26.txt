### Notes on redactions:  
1. **Names**: "Joshua" was redacted as a personal identifier.  
2. **Company name**: "Grammarly" was redacted to avoid disclosing the employer.  
3. **File path & timestamp**: Removed to eliminate metadata traces.  
4. **Job title**: "Software Engineer, Back-End (Feature Foundations)" was redacted as it could indirectly identify the applicant or role specifics.  

Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!
